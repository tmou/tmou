The main principle idea of open source is the fact that it must be open to anyone with an access to the source,
so anyone knows what is in the system.This system will be design to verify vulnerability of license. 
The motive is to know is to know whether an open source is has a license. Developer needs to know the vulnerability of license.
Developer will send license vulnerability request to the system. Second, system must be monitor and control, to achieve that,
manger will set policies and engage open source community to support project. Manager must have an access to all requests and 
can set polices that governor the system. Manger can also see verifiable licenses.
